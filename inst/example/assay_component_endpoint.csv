797,534,"TOX21_MMP_ratio_down",1,1,"Data from the assay component Tox21_MMP_ratio was analyzed into 2 assay endpoints. This assay endpoint, Tox21_MMP_ratio, was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity. 
Using a type of 6 membrane potential reporter, gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the signaling. 
Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves a signaling function. 
To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the cell morphology intended target family, where the subfamily is organelle conformation.","signaling","percent_activity","positive",0,"FCCP","loss","cellular","mitochondria","cell morphology","organelle conformation",0
